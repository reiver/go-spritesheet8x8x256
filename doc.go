/*
Package spritesheet8x8x256 provides a type that represents a sprite sheet of 256 8Ã—8 sprites,
that seamlessly works with Go's built-in "image", "image/color", and "image/draw" packages.

The slice- and array- indexing of the pixels / pels in each sprite is as follows:

	 0  1  2  3
	 4  5  6  7
	 8  9 10 11
	12 13 14 15
